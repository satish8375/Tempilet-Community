# 🎨 Tempilet Community Templates

Welcome to the Tempilet Community! This is the official hub where designers share their creative layouts with the world.

## 🚀 How to Contribute Your Template

We follow a professional **Pull Request (PR)** system to ensure high-quality and safe templates for all users. Follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Finish Your Design
Open the **Tempilet App**, finalize your design, and export it for the Community. You will get a `.json` file (Layout) and a `.png` file (Preview).

### 2️⃣ Fork This Repository
Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page to create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.

### 3️⃣ Upload Your Files
In your **Forked Repository**:
- Upload your `.json` file to the `templates/` folder.
- Upload your `.png` file to the `previews/` folder.
- **Note:** Make sure both files have the same name (e.g., `my_design.json` and `my_design.png`).

### 4️⃣ Submit a Pull Request (PR)
Once uploaded, go to the original **Tempilet-Community** repository and click on **"New Pull Request"**. 
- Submit your request for review.
- The Admin will check your design for quality and safety.

### 5️⃣ Approval & Automation
- Once the Admin **Approves** and **Merges** your Pull Request, your design will be added to the `main` branch.
